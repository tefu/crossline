Crossline is an attempt to show how [curvilinear perpective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_perspective) 
can be used to emulate
[1-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#One-point_perspective), 
[2-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#Two-point_perspective), and
[3-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#Three-point_perspective) perspective.

For now, it's a web app that lets you draw cubes.

Total work in progress.
